*The Supply Chain Forecaster dashboard provides an intuitive interface for forecasting and anomaly detection.*

## Performance Optimization

The dashboard has been optimized for performance, particularly when working with large datasets:

- **Component Caching**: Dashboard components are cached to reduce rendering time on repeated views
- **Data Downsampling**: Large time series datasets are intelligently downsampled for faster visualization
- **Chart Optimization**: Charts are optimized to render efficiently, even with complex visualizations
- **Smart Pagination**: Data tables use pagination to avoid loading too many rows at once

These optimizations help maintain responsive performance even when working with large supply chain datasets.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is organized into five main sections, each accessible from the navigation bar:

1. **Home** - Overview and access to key features
2. **Data Exploration** - Tools for exploring and analyzing supply chain data
3. **Forecasting** - Creating and using forecasting models
4. **Anomaly Detection** - Identifying abnormal patterns in data
5. **Model Management** - Managing trained and deployed models

## Home Page

The Home page provides an overview of the system's capabilities and quick access to key features.

**Key Components:**
- System overview and key metrics
- Quick links to frequently used features
- Recent activity and model status

**Use Case:** Use the Home page to get a high-level view of your supply chain forecasting system and quickly navigate to the most relevant features.

## Data Exploration

The Data Exploration page allows you to upload, visualize, and analyze your supply chain data.

**Key Components:**
- Data upload interface for CSV files
- Data preview table with pagination
- Time series visualization tools
- Correlation analysis tools
- Summary statistics

**Use Case Example:** Upload historical inventory data to identify seasonal patterns and correlations between features that might impact demand.

### Data Upload Process

1. Click the "Upload Data" button or drag and drop a file
2. Select columns for visualization
3. Choose visualization type (line chart, bar chart, scatter plot, etc.)
4. Apply filters or transformations as needed
5. Export or save visualizations for reports

## Forecasting

The Forecasting page allows you to train forecasting models and generate predictions.

**Key Components:**
- Model training interface
- Forecast generation interface
- Cross-validation tools
- Performance metrics visualization
- Model comparison tools

### Training a Forecasting Model

The model training interface provides a guided workflow for creating a forecasting model.

**Steps:**
1. Upload training data
2. Select model type (Prophet, ARIMA, XGBoost, or LSTM)
3. Configure model parameters
   - Prophet: Seasonality type, changepoint prior, etc.
   - ARIMA: Order parameters (p,d,q)
   - XGBoost: Tree parameters, learning rate, etc.
   - LSTM: Network architecture, epochs, etc.
4. Select feature columns, target column, and date column
5. Start training process
6. Review training results and performance metrics

**Advanced Options:**
- Feature engineering settings
- Cross-validation configuration
- Hyperparameter optimization

### Generating Forecasts

Once you have a trained model, you can generate forecasts for future periods.

**Steps:**
1. Select a trained model
2. Upload feature data for the forecast period (or use auto-generated dates)
3. Configure forecast settings (horizon, confidence intervals, etc.)
4. Generate the forecast
5. View and interact with the forecast visualization
6. Export forecast results (CSV, Excel, etc.)

## Anomaly Detection

The Anomaly Detection page provides tools for identifying unusual patterns or outliers in your supply chain data.

**Key Components:**
- Anomaly detection model training
- Anomaly detection interface
- Visualization of detected anomalies
- Anomaly explanation tools

### Training an Anomaly Detection Model

**Steps:**
1. Upload training data
2. Select anomaly detection algorithm:
   - Isolation Forest: For general anomaly detection
   - Statistical: For time series with clear patterns
   - Autoencoder: For complex, high-dimensional data
3. Configure algorithm parameters
4. Select feature columns
5. Start training process
6. Review anomaly distribution and training results

### Detecting Anomalies

**Steps:**
1. Select a trained anomaly detection model
2. Upload data for analysis
3. Configure detection settings (threshold, sensitivity, etc.)
4. Run anomaly detection
5. View detected anomalies highlighted in the data
6. Export anomaly detection results

## Model Management

The Model Management page allows you to view, compare, deploy, and delete trained models.

**Key Components:**
- Model list with filtering and sorting
- Model details view with performance metrics
- Model deployment interface
- Model comparison tools
- Model deletion interface

**Use Case Example:** Compare the performance of multiple forecasting models on the same data to select the best model for deployment.

### Model Deployment

**Steps:**
1. Select a trained model from the list
2. Review model performance metrics
3. Click "Deploy Model" to make the model available for production use
4. Configure deployment settings (if applicable)
5. Confirm deployment

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Data Quality**
   - Ensure your data has proper date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Check for missing values before uploading
   - Include features that may influence the target variable

2. **Model Selection**
   - For data with strong seasonality: Prophet or ARIMA
   - For complex relationships with many features: XGBoost or LSTM
   - When unsure, try multiple models and compare performance

3. **Forecast Evaluation**
   - Always check model metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE)
   - Use cross-validation for more reliable performance assessment
   - Consider business context when interpreting forecast accuracy

4. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Start with a more sensitive threshold and adjust as needed
   - Combine multiple anomaly detection methods for better results
   - Validate detected anomalies with domain expertise
