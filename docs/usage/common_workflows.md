## End-to-End Forecasting Workflow

This workflow covers the entire process from data ingestion to forecast evaluation and deployment.

### 1. Data Preparation

**Steps:**
1. Collect historical supply chain data (demand, inventory, etc.)
2. Format data as a CSV file with:
   - Date column in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Target variable (what you want to forecast)
   - Relevant features (factors that influence the target)
3. Handle missing values and outliers:
   - Fill small gaps using interpolation
   - Remove extreme outliers or replace with reasonable values
   - Ensure consistent date ranges (daily, weekly, monthly)
4. Add external factors if available:
   - Promotions, price changes
   - Holidays, seasons
   - Economic indicators

**Example CSV format:**
```
date,demand,price,promotion,holiday
2023-01-01,120,19.99,0,1
2023-01-02,105,19.99,0,0
