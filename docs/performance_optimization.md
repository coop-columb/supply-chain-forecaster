# Performance Optimization Guide

This guide covers the performance optimization strategy for the Supply Chain Forecaster system, including profiling techniques, common bottlenecks, and optimization approaches.

## Performance Profiling

The system includes built-in profiling tools to help identify performance bottlenecks in various components:

- API endpoints
- Model training and inference
- Dashboard loading and rendering
- Data processing operations

### Running with Profiling Enabled

To enable profiling in your development environment:

```bash
# Run the API with profiling enabled
./scripts/run_with_profiling.sh

# Or set environment variables manually
export ENABLE_PROFILING=true
export PROFILING_SAMPLE_RATE=1.0
python -m api.main
```

### Collecting Profiling Data

Performance data is collected automatically when profiling is enabled. You can:

1. Access real-time profiling data through the API endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/profiling/stats`
2. Run the profiling script to collect more detailed data: `python scripts/profile_application.py`
3. Generate visualizations from profiling data: `python scripts/analyze_profiling.py`

## Common Performance Bottlenecks

Based on our analysis, these are the most common performance bottlenecks:

### API Performance

- **CSV File Loading**: Loading large CSV files can cause memory spikes
- **Model Loading**: Loading models from disk for each request is slow
- **Data Serialization**: Converting large datasets to/from JSON can be inefficient

### Model Performance

- **Model Training**: Training deep learning models (LSTM) can be slow
- **Inference Latency**: Real-time prediction with complex models
- **Feature Engineering**: Preprocessing steps taking too long

### Dashboard Performance

- **Data Loading**: Loading large datasets for visualization
- **Rendering**: Complex charts with many data points
- **Callback Chains**: Multiple dependent callbacks creating a waterfall effect

## Optimization Strategies

### API Optimization

1. **Model Caching**:
   ```python
   # Cache models in memory using LRU cache
   @lru_cache(maxsize=10)
   def get_model(model_name, model_type):
       return load_model(model_name, model_type)
   ```

2. **Chunked File Processing**:
   ```python
   # Process large files in chunks
   def process_large_file(file_path):
       for chunk in pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=10000):
           process_chunk(chunk)
   ```

3. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   ```python
   # Use async for I/O-bound operations
   async def fetch_data(urls):
       tasks = [fetch_url(url) for url in urls]
       return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
   ```

### Model Optimization

1. **Batch Inference**:
   ```python
   # Process multiple predictions at once
   def batch_predict(model, batch_data):
       return model.predict(batch_data)
   ```

2. **Model Quantization**:
   ```python
   # Reduce model size and improve inference speed
   def quantize_model(model):
       return tf.quantization.quantize_model(model)
   ```

3. **Feature Selection**:
   ```python
   # Use only the most important features
   def select_features(data, feature_importance):
       threshold = 0.01
       important_features = [f for f, imp in feature_importance.items() if imp > threshold]
       return data[important_features]
   ```

### Dashboard Optimization

1. **Data Downsampling**:
   ```python
   # Downsample large datasets for visualization
   def downsample_for_chart(df, max_points=1000):
       if len(df) > max_points:
           return df.iloc[::len(df)//max_points]
       return df
   ```

2. **Lazy Loading**:
   ```python
   # Load components only when needed
   @app.callback(
       Output("component-container", "children"),
       [Input("tab", "value")]
   )
   def load_tab_content(tab):
       if tab == "tab1":
           return create_tab1_content()
       return []
   ```

3. **Client-Side Callbacks**:
   ```javascript
   // Use client-side callbacks for simple UI interactions
   app.clientside_callback(
       """
       function(value) {
           return value;
       }
       """,
       Output("output-id", "children"),
       Input("input-id", "value"),
   )
   ```

## Measuring Optimization Results

After implementing optimizations, it's important to measure their impact:

1. Run the profiling script again: `python scripts/profile_application.py`
2. Compare the results before and after optimization
3. Use the built-in Prometheus metrics to monitor long-term performance trends
